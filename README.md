Capstone Portfolio
Data Science / Software Engineering Projects


PROJECT 1: NBA Shot Chart

The first project in this portfolio is the shot chart of NBA players.
This project finds a specific player from any NBA team and retrives data on said player using the NBA api.
The NBA api allows the user to search through multiple endpoints which include assist tracker, franchise leaders, 
and so many other useful stats stored in the database.
In this project, I gathered player data from Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid from the 2020-2021 season.
In order to plot their makes and misses, I needed to first create a visual representation of the court.
This was created using a function built into Spyder (programming software) called Matplotlib.
This allowed me to create a sketch of the court, which then shows the official shot chart for each selected player.
This project is a great gateway into the realm of data science because it includes accessing data, programming, and representing it visually.


PROJECT 2: Connecting to an API

In project 2 ny team and I connected to multiple music streaming API's. The streaming service I choose is called Deezer.
I focuesed on getting the top 50 songs off of their charts. This allowed me to gain information such as
Track title, artist name, the album the track is from, and a link to the artist profile page. 
This information was then stored in an online database using MYSQL. From there my team and I designed a website
that would display the data we had stored. The site allowed you to look search for a song and find other information about it.
Unfortuanatley the online database has been deactivated since we finished the project, which means the website is offline as well.
Nonetheless, I am able to show that I could connect to the API and retrieve information for our project.

What is an API? 
"API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, youâ€™re using an API."

PROJECT 3: VosViewer

Basis of VosViewer: 
VOSviewer is a software tool for creating maps based on network data and for
visualizing and exploring these maps. 
VOSviewer can be used to construct networks of scientific publications,
scientific journals, researchers, research organizations, countries, keywords, or
terms. Items in these networks can be connected by co-authorship, cooccurrence, citation, bibliographic coupling, or co-citation links.
Although VOSviewer is intended primarily for analyzing bibliometric networks, it
can in fact be used to create, visualize, and explore maps based on any type of
network data.

For this project I extracted data from excel and plugged it in to the software VosViewer. With this data,
I had the ability to create visual representations of scientifical journals. In this project, I included common keywords,
most relavant authors, and most used journals.
