PROJECT 1: NBA Shot Chart

The first project in this portfolio is the shot chart of NBA players.
This project finds a specific player from any NBA team and retrives data on said player using the NBA api.
The NBA api allows the user to search through multiple endpoints which include assist tracker, franchise leaders, 
and so many other useful stats stored in the database.
In this project, I gathered player data from Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid from the 2020-2021 season.
In order to plot their makes and misses, I needed to first create a visual representation of the court.
This was created using a function built into Spyder (programming software) called Matplotlib.
This allowed me to create a sketch of the court, which then shows the official shot chart for each selected player.
This project is a great gateway into the realm of data science because it includes accessing data, programming, and representing it visually.

VOSviewer is a software tool for creating maps based on network data and for
visualizing and exploring these maps. 

VOSviewer can be used to construct networks of scientific publications,
scientific journals, researchers, research organizations, countries, keywords, or
terms. Items in these networks can be connected by co-authorship, cooccurrence, citation, bibliographic coupling, or co-citation links

Although VOSviewer is intended primarily for analyzing bibliometric networks, it
can in fact be used to create, visualize, and explore maps based on any type of
network data.
