VOSviewer is a software tool for creating maps based on network data and for
visualizing and exploring these maps. 

VOSviewer can be used to construct networks of scientific publications,
scientific journals, researchers, research organizations, countries, keywords, or
terms. Items in these networks can be connected by co-authorship, cooccurrence, citation, bibliographic coupling, or co-citation links

Although VOSviewer is intended primarily for analyzing bibliometric networks, it
can in fact be used to create, visualize, and explore maps based on any type of
network data.
